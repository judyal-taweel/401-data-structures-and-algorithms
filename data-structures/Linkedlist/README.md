<!-- Description of the challenge -->

create node class has two propareties data and pointer to the next node and linkedlist class has head property and has three methods insert , include , toString.


## Approach & Efficiency

Big O: O(1) in insert method and O(n) in include method.
## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
insert: method takes value and add the new node to the head.
